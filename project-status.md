- Some linter errors in ClientHomeContent component need to be addressed

## Next Steps
1. Resolve linter errors in ClientHomeContent component
2. Design and implement the user card component for the swipe interface
3. Set up backend API for fetching potential matches
4. Implement swipe gestures and animations
5. Develop logic for handling user interactions (likes, dislikes, matches)
6. Create a match notification system
7. Begin work on GitHub OAuth integration
8. Start designing the matching algorithm
9. Implement a system to manage internship applications
10. Gather feedback on the new internship page and iterate if necessary

## Long-term Goals
- Implement a recommendation system for potential matches
- Develop a mobile app version
- Integrate with more coding platforms and version control systems
- Implement advanced analytics for user behavior and successful matches
- Expand the internship program and potentially create more roles

## Notes
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set in .env.local
- Keep monitoring performance and optimize as necessary
- Regularly update dependencies and address any security vulnerabilities
- Consider creating a more comprehensive careers page in the future

## Progress Made
- Fixed linter errors in `app/api/fetchgit/route.ts` and `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/authOptions.ts`.
- Corrected import paths and added missing type declarations.
- Explicitly typed parameters to resolve implicit `any` type errors.

## New Decisions
- Ensure all imports are correctly referenced and installed.
- Explicitly type all parameters to avoid implicit `any` type errors.

## Upcoming Tasks
- Review and refactor other files for similar issues.
- Implement unit tests for the updated functions.
- Continue to modernize legacy code to TypeScript.

## Other Relevant Information
- Ensure consistent use of environment variables for sensitive data.
- Maintain strict adherence to Apple's aesthetic standards in UI/UX design.
